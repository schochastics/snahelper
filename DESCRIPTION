Description: 'RStudio' addin which provides a GUI to visualize and analyse networks.

    Alternatively, the function SNAhelperGadget() can be used directly from the console.
    Additional addins include the Netreader() for reading network files, Netbuilder() to create
    small networks via point and click, and the Componentlayouter() to layout networks with many components manually.
